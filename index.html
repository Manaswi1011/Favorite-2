        <p>My hobby is reading books. Whenever I get free time, I read books and I enjoy it. My teacher always tells us that reading is very important for children as we gain a lot of knowledge through it.
            My parents also buy books for me. I have read many series like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson , Find Outers, Big Nate , Amar Chitra Katha ,Tinkle , Heroes of Olympus and many more. My favorite book is Percy Jackson and the Lighting Thief
